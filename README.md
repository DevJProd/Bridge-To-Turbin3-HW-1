# Bridge-To-Turbin3-HW-1

### Homework assignment for Lesson 1: Introduction to Solana's Architecture and Ecosystem, covered in the Bridge to Turbin-3 Bootcamp by Rise in. ###
- Install Solana Development Environment: Set up Rust, Cargo, and the Solana Tool Suite to compile and deploy Solana programs.
- Generate a Keypair: Use the keygen.ts script to create a new Solana wallet and keypair. The generated keypair is stored locally in a dev-wallet.json file, which will be used for further transactions.
- Claim a Token Airdrop: Connect to the Solana Devnet and request SOL tokens using the airdrop.ts script. The script establishes a connection to the Devnet and requests 2 SOL tokens for the generated wallet.
